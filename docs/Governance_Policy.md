# MUDRA Governance Policy

MUDRA is a fully decentralized blockchain governed by its community.

**Core Principles:**
- 1 Human = 1 Vote (verified via Idena or BrightID)
- No central authority after launch
- Forks can be created freely
- Official forks require community approval and contribute 10% of net profits to the developer wallet
- Energy optimization prioritized: mining is throttled, mobile-friendly, and hybrid PoW/PoS

**Voting Process:**
- Proposals submitted on-chain
- 7-day voting period
- Majority approval required
